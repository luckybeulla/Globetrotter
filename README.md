## Unit 1 Assignment: Globetrotter

Submitted by: **LUCKY BEULLA MUHOZA**

Estimated time spent: **17** hours spent in total

Deployed Application (optional): [Globetrotter Deployed Site]
(https://luckybeulla.github.io/Globetrotter/)

For some reason, the website background does not show on the deployed website but is visible when I go live from VSCode. I attempted to fix it but did not succeed.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Flexbox elements like justify-content, align-items, flex-direction and many more helped me add the website's responsive design. 

Media queries were also helpful to ensure the video in the homepage section did not get distorted as the viewport on which the website is displayed changes.

The concept of semantic HTML was essential in organizing my html code so I could easily customize specific sections in CSS.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

With more time, I could play around with the arrangement of images in the photo gallery section, for example, like creating a sliding gallery.

I would also add more user interactive features like maps, dropdown menu.

The website design still looks plain thus I would add visual aesthetics like cards, box shadows.

Figure out how to make the navigation bar stay fixed at the top as the user scrolls through the site while the width of the bar still adjusts to the screen size (i.e only fixed at the top and not left or right)

Make each section be its own page


* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Face the crowd while presenting
Make sure I do not go over the allocated time.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

I appreciate instructor Erika for being patient me as I tried to understand how flexbox works. 

Thanks to Ahmed I was able to use semantic html in my code

Shoutout to my housemates for moral support, and specifically Kiahna for helping me figure out how to deploy the website
